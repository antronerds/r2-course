# R2 Courses

This contains courses for the molecular biology data analysis platform R2 (r2-platform.com r2.amc.nl)

We have to think about the structure of the course currently given at the Academic Medical Center from the University of Amsterdam; course title does not cover the topics: Molecular Genetics; while it only studies the pathways in CRC and the MES/NE switch in Neuroblastoma (it is part of the Biomedical Sciences Bachelor). A preliminary search (bioinformatics of oncology) reveals that we’re probably stretching a bit; most courses found are for phd/researchers. However, these and also more basic courses cover a broader range of topics. So try to set this up as a simpler (more click through) research project (including the research cycle) leading to a research conclusion; several endpoints that can be presented...

### Steps to change this
* Check other sources; ongoing
* Study the actual book
* Define learning goals
* Search examples from literature that used R2 for publication

### Other ideas
* follow several articles that were published using R2
* Use a Docker inspired environment; so including working links directly showing the actual example in R2
* Further elaborate upon the current setup; wider range of topics, less deep but still on an example basis
* Use Kris’s tips
* Integrate this into RTD format; linked to an R2 datascope; already setup using form variables (a la Docker)


As an aid I pasted the detailed table of contents of the book here. This actually follows a pretty decent logical flow.
We can use this as an aid to formulate several microworkflows that lead the stu
