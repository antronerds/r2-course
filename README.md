This contains courses for the molecular biology data analysis platform R2 (r2-platform.com r2.amc.nl)

We have to think about the structure of the course currently given at the Academic Medical Center from the University of Amsterdam; course title does not cover the topics: Molecular Genetics; while it only studies the pathways in CRC and the MES/NE switch in Neuroblastoma (it is part of the Biomedical Sciences Bachelor)
check other sources; ongoing
a preliminary search (bioinformatics of oncology) reveals that we’re probably stretching a bit; most courses found are for phd/researchers: examples: these and these
however, these and also more basic courses cover a broader range of topics
so try to set this up as a simpler (more click through) research project (including the research cycle) leading to a research conclusion; several endpoints that can be presented...
Steps:
Study the actual book
Define learning goals

Some ideas: follow several articles that were published using R2
Use a Docker inspired environment; so including working links directly showing the actual example in R2
Further elaborate upon the current setup; wider range of topics, less deep but still on an example basis
Use Kris’s tips
Integrate this into RTD format; linked to an R2 datascope; already setup using form variables (a la Docker)
