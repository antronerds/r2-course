RNAseq data analysis using rheumatoid arthritis data
===========================================

*Using a dataset from Rheumatoid Arthritis a generic approach for RNA data analysis is explored*


Introduction
-----

-  A general workflow of RNA data analysis consists of the following steps 
1.  Explore your samples
  -  Unbiased unsupervised clustering
  	- PCA, tSNE, UMAP 
  - Goals
  	- Data check; bias?
	- Groups?
2. Explore differences between groups
  - Differential expression
  - Specific (groups of) genes

3. Explore patterns
  - Overrepresentation
    - Gene Ontology
    - Pathways

4. Explore relations
  - Generate a signature
  - Compare with other signatures


Explore your samples

1.  This will give a numbered list
2.  Next item
	
	To continue numbering after enter or figure, indent the whole paragraph with a tab, or more tabs when in sublist
	
3.  And the third continues

Any text between restarts numbering

4.  Next list
  1. Two spaces create a sublist
  *  They can be mixed

Images are formatted as follows:

[**Figure 11: the extra settings Panel**](_static/images/OneGene_Adapting.png)

Note the enter between the lines; this is to guarantee proper formatting in pdf

The Did you know box is formatted as follows

---------
  ![](_static/images/R2d2_logo.png)**Did you know box**


> *Three or more minusses preceded by a return create a line; the > sign in front of a paragraph indents the whole paragraph and the single asterisks put it in italic*

---------

You'll have to get used to the use of spaces and enters in Markdown; these are used for formatting


  Two spaces at the start of a line creates a paragraph
