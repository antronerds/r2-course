#Investigating Tumor Heterogeneity


*Learn how to use the R2 data analysis platform to analyse tumor heterogeneity in Neuroblastoma*


Introduction
-----

Cancer is a very complex disease. Much more complicated than originally anticipated when the first mutations were found to be causal for specific cancers. During the lectures you’ve been shown how this works in colorectal cancer, where a well defined path of subsequent gained mutations leads to more aggressive tumorigenic cell types. 
Although there has been extensive research into similar mutation mechanisms in Neuroblastoma (also in our group), there has been no such mechanism found for this cancer type. In this practical work we want to try to bring you to the cutting edge of research into this dangerous childhood tumor. From the lectures you should have learned already that this tumor seems to be heterogenic by nature. There is reason to believe that this heterogeneity causes the high percentage of relapses in the aggressive subtype of Neuroblastoma. Children experiencing a relapse almost always die. 
Fortunately new technologies have become available to molecular biology. These enable us to study not only the mutations and RNA expression of genes but also study the epigenetic modifications of the DNA. And not only that but genes can now be manipulated in cell lines and living tissues. 
Using advanced data analysis, statistics and clustering methods, the new field of bioinformatics tries to derive new insights from these experimental data and help molecular biologists to generate new hypotheses that can be tested experimentally.
Today you’ll use a web-based platform, R2, that provides you with a set of such bioinformatics tools to investigate recent patient and experimental data from Neuroblastoma tumors and cell lines. 
Neuroblastoma is a pediatric tumor of the peripheral adrenergic lineage, which is derived from the neural crest. During embryogenesis, cells delaminate from the neural crest, migrate ventrally and differentiate into adrenaline- or noradrenaline-producing cells. Neuroblastomas typically express enzymes for the adrenaline-synthesis route. High-stage neuroblastomas usually go into complete remission upon therapy but often relapse as therapy-resistant disease.
