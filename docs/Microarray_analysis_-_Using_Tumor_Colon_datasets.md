Finding and analyzing differential expressed genes using two Colon datasets
=================================

*Finding and analyzing differential expressed genes using two Colon datasets*

The purpose of this practical session is to get a grip on microarray data analysis.
We will try to answer some questions using two colorectal cancer datasets by applying
the web based analysis platform R2 (http://r2.amc.nl ir http://r2platform.com) which has been developed within
the Department of Oncogenomics at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in Amsterdam,
the Netherlands. The principles and features you will encounter during this workshop
are well established in the community that analyze and visualize microarray data.
An online step by step tutorial book is available in the help section of R2.
We will often refer to these tutorials.
