Transcription Factors and Expression
===========================

*Find out how Transcription factors regulate gene expression*


Introduction 
------------
See Finding structural variants

High stage Neuroblastoma

TERT appeared to translocate to specific regions

Methylation/Acetylation; marks of open/closed active/inactive chromatine regions

Enhancers
---------
Tert translocate to enhancer regions

Open Genomebrowser

Intermezzo: subtypes in Neuroblastoma
-------------------------------------
In the first part of this course 

Super Enhancers
---------------
Types in Neuroblastoma exhibit different enhancer landscapes

Transcription factors differentially expressed
